                <h2>NoDisk OS</h2>
                <p>NoDisk OS was a scratch project that simulates an OS. There were three versions, NoDisk OS, NoDisk OS Mobile and NoDisk OS Lite.</p>
                <p>There were plans for a major rewrite, called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/765731660/">NoDisk OS Meteor</a>, but that sadly never made it.</p>
                <p>NoDisk OS was started at July 7, 2022, and discontinued at Aug. 8, 2023, because for members of the team their summer break ended, and simply did not have enough time for NoDisk OS anymore.</p>
                <p>NoDisk OS Mobile was started at Aug 11, 2022 and discontinued at Aug. 8, 2023. (It suffered the same fate as NoDisk OS) The goal of NoDisk OS Mobile was to be a mobile port of NoDisk OS.</p>
                <p>NoDisk OS Lite was started at Aug. 29, 2022, and discontinued at Aug. 31, 2022 since there wasn't a lite version necessary.</p>
